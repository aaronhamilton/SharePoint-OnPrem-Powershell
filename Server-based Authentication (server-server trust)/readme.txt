There are 3 files, numbered 1-3. Run the files in order

1. First file, you can run from anywhere, but you will need to authenticate with an Azure Admin account, possible requiring MFA, so you may want to run this from your local PC.
2. Second file, run from inside your SharePoint farm - it needs to be run every time you add a new SP web application.
3. Third file, run from  inside your SharePoint farm - it needs to be run every time you add a new Site Collection

The fourth file is the original script as a single file - just for reference purposes now
